# ACCUNOX-Project-Log-file-analyzer

This Python script monitors system health using the psutil library and logs the results. It checks CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and the number of running processes against predefined thresholds. If any metric exceeds its threshold, a warning is logged. All system health metrics are logged with timestamps for easy tracking and analysis.
